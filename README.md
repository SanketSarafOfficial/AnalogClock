# AnalogClock


This is my 2nd Project and I have made an analog clock that is responsive as well as working.
I have used web development weapons that are HTML , CSS and JavaScript.
To run and rotate the clock I have used the rotate function in Javascript.
The image is responsive in any device you are using .
*** BASED ON PURE HTML, CSS AND JAVASCRIPT ***
